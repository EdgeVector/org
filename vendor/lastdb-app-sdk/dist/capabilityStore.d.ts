/**
 * App-side capability storage.
 *
 * The design mandates the OS keychain for capability tokens, with a file
 * fallback only on headless machines (`app_identity.md`, decision
 * 2026-05-27: "OS keychain mandated; file fallback only on headless Linux").
 *
 * We implement the keychain via the platform's native credential CLI rather
 * than a native node addon (keytar is unmaintained and a build-time burden):
 * - macOS: the `security` binary (`add-generic-password` / `find-generic-password`).
 * - Other platforms / headless: a `0o600` file under `$FOLDDB_APP_SDK_HOME`
 *   (default `~/.folddb-app-sdk/capabilities/`), the same SSH-like model the
 *   node uses when its `removed-keychain-feature` feature is off.
 *
 * ## Per-node keying (gap #2)
 *
 * A capability is minted by ONE node for ONE app. An app that connects to more
 * than one node (or whose node URL changes) must not replay node A's capability
 * against node B. So an entry is keyed by **(appId, nodeTarget)**, not by
 * `appId` alone, and the stored value is a small JSON envelope that *also*
 * records the `boundNode` it was minted for. `load(key, { expectedNode })`
 * returns the capability only when its `boundNode` matches the connection's
 * node; a mismatch (or a legacy bare-string entry from before this envelope)
 * is treated as **absent** (`null`), never blindly replayed. The composite key
 * already makes a cross-node hit structurally unlikely; the `boundNode` check
 * is the defense-in-depth that also catches a hand-injected or stale entry.
 *
 * The keychain **service name** is configurable per store (see
 * `ConnectOptions.keychainService`); the default keeps every existing entry
 * working.
 */
/**
 * Options for a {@link CapabilityStore.load}. `expectedNode` is the canonical
 * target string of the connection asking for the capability (the transport's
 * `target`, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:9101` or `unix:/path/to.sock`). When set,
 * a stored capability whose `boundNode` differs is treated as absent — the

 *
 * NOTE (v2 — gap #2): the interface keys by an opaque `key: string`, not by
 * `appId`. Pre-v2 the methods took an `appId`; the client now passes a
 * node-scoped composite key so a capability minted for one node is stored
 * separately from another node's. A custom store written against the old
