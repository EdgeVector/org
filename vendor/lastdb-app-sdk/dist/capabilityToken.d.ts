/**
 * Client-side capability-token decode + integrity verification (gap #4).
 *
 * The node mints a `CapabilityToken` (base64 JSON) whose `envelope.payload_hash`
 * is `sha256(JCS(token-minus-envelope))` — see
 * `fold/fold_db/crates/core/src/access/caller_context.rs::CapabilityToken` and
 * `fold/app_identity_crypto` (`compute_payload_hash`). An SDK app is a TOKEN
 * CARRIER: the node mints + signs; the app stores the opaque base64 blob and
 * replays it verbatim. It never re-signs. What the app CAN do client-side is:
 *
 *   - **integrity binding** — recompute `sha256(JCS(token-minus-envelope))`
 *     and compare it to `envelope.payload_hash`, with the same RFC 8785 JCS
 *     the Rust node uses. A tampered / truncated / bit-rotted cached blob
 *     fails here and is discarded instead of being replayed into a
 *     guaranteed `403 {reason: "capability_bad_sig"}`.
 *   - **audience binding** — check the token's `app_id` is the app the client
 *     acts as, so a token granted to another app is never stored or replayed.
 *
 * Neither check substitutes for the node's Ed25519 signature verification
 * (which needs the node's key); they make the client fail fast and keep its
 * cache clean. Enable them on the client via
 * `ConnectOptions.verifyCapability: true`, or call these helpers directly.
